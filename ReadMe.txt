The two .py files showcase the results of a simulated traffic control system.

File "trafficSim" contains a python library that may cause it to not run on all systems.
This library is removed in file "trafficSimWithoutMatPlotLib", and this file can be run to
observe data without displaying the data on plots.

Opening terminal and running the file from there should prevent the terminal from closing
when the script finishes, allowing for inspection of data
